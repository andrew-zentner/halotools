Tutorial on managing raw ASCII halo catalog data
*************************************************

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to use Halotools to start
from scratch by downloading raw ASCII halo catalog data and producing
your own reduced binary, appropriately processed for your science
target. Before following this tutorial, you will probably find it
helpful to first read the :ref:`using-halocat-binaries`, so that you
have a sense of what the end product will be like to work with.
