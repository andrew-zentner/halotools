Simulations and halo catalogs supported by Halotools

Halotools is configured to download, process and manage a range of  
state-of-the-art simulations and halo catalogs. Below we give a 
brief description of each of the simulations supported by the package.
If you would like to use your own catalog, rather than one of the simulations listed below,
