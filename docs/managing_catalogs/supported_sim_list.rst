*****************************************************
Simulations and halo catalogs supported by Halotools
*****************************************************

Halotools is configured to download, process and manage a range of  
state-of-the-art simulations and halo catalogs. Below we give a 
brief description of each of the simulations supported by the package.
If you would like to use your own catalog, rather than one of the simulations listed below, 
see the :ref:`using_your_own_catalog`. 

Bolshoi
========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5 cosmology 
with Lbox = 250 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e8 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see

Bolshoi-Planck 
===============
Cosmological N-body simulation of Planck 2013 cosmology 
with Lbox = 250 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e8 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see 
http://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/bolshoip-project/bolshoip/. 

Multidark 
==========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5 cosmology 
with Lbox = 1Gpc/h and particle mass of ~1e10 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see 
http://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/multidark-project/mdr1. 

Consuelo
=========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5-like cosmology 
with Lbox = 400 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e9 Msun/h.
