Step-by-step guide to managing halo catalogs 
********************************************************************

In these notes we will describe the process of halo catalog management, 
start-to-finish. We'll start out with the section :ref:`using_preprocessed_halocats`, 
which will describe how to download and quickly begin using 
the pre-processed binary reductions provided by the Halotools team. 
Then, in :ref:`using_raw_halocats`, we'll walk you through how to download  
raw ASCII data, choose your own cuts, and produce and manage your own binaries. 


.. _using_preprocessed_halocats:

Using pre-processed binary files
====================================

If you followed the :ref:`first_steps` section of the documentation, 
then you already have at least one pre-processed binary halo catalog in your cache. 




.. _using_raw_halocats:

Starting from scratch with raw ASCII
=======================================
