Requirements
============

Halotools is built upon the following core dependencies:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_: 2.7, 3.3, or 3.4

- `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_: 1.9 or later

- `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_: 0.15 or later

- `Astropy`_: 1.0 or later

Halotools also depends on other packages for optional features and enhanced performance:

- `h5py <http://h5py.org/>`_: For fast I/O of large simulated datasets.

- `mpi4py <http://mpi4py.scipy.org/>`_: For parallelizing calculations such as MCMCs and various expensive simulation analyses.

However, note that these only need to be installed if those particular features
are needed. Halotools will import even if these dependencies are not installed.
